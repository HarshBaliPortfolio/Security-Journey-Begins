# Overview 
In an organisation, conducting audits ensures that important security checks are made, in-order to identify weaknesses within the current security posture, which can affect an organisation's business continuity and critical assets. My manager requested me to support the organisation with carrying out an internal audit. 


## These are the tasks I performed:
1. First, I reviewed, Using the [Botium Scope, Goals & objectives](/Resources/BotiumScope.docx.pdf) and [Control categories](/Resources/ControlCategories.docx.pdf) documents respectively. 
2. Then I completed the [Compliance Checklist](/ComplianceChecklist.docx.pdf) document to determine the regulations that the organisation must comply with, in-order to operate legally.
3. After that, I completed the [Control Assessment](/ControlsAssessment.docx.pdf) document to suggest controls that the organisation will need to improve the security posture and comply with laws. 
4. Then, I created the [Botium Memorandum](/BotiumAuditMemmorandum.docx.pdf) document to communicate my findings and recommendations from the audit to all the stakeholders.


## Case study:
Botium Toys is a small U.S. business that develops and sells toys. The business has a single physical location. However, its online presence has grown, attracting customers in the U.S. and abroad. Their information technology (IT) department is under increasing pressure to support their online market worldwide. 
The manager of the IT department has decided that an internal IT audit needs to be conducted. The manager is also interested in ensuring that they comply with regulations related to accepting online payments and conducting business in the European Union (E.U.).
