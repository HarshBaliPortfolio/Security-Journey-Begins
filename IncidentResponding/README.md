# Overview
Playbooks can be considered as manuals that outline standard operating procedures and steps for responding and resolving incidents.SOC analysts / Incident Responders use playbooks as a guide to help them deal with the security incident. After the security incident is dealt with, the responding team conducts a Post-Incident activity where they determine whether the playbook may require an update to deal with similar incidents in a better way. 

## These are the following steps that I undertook to complete this activity:
1. First, I went through the [Phishing Incident Response Playbook](/IncidentResponding/IncidentResponsePlaybook_Phishing%20.pdf) to refresh myself on how to respond to such incidents. 
2. Then, I examined the email as per the Playbook. Tools recommended (https://www.virustotal.com).
3. Updated the [ticket](/IncidentResponding/AlertTicket.pdf).

## Case Study
You work as a SOC analyst at an organisation. Recently, the HR department has received a suspected phishing email and they have forwarded the email to SOC for further investigation. It is your responsibility to investigate this further as per the Phishing Incident Response Playbook.
